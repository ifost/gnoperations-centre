Write a class that can be used as  connection_constructor 
for gnpcIncomingConnectionWrapper.
(There would be at least two -- one for proxyTelnet,  the other for
gnpcMessage transferal)

 ( I have written gnpcMessageTransferConnectionWrapper for this
   purpose.  Read through the protocol in it and gnpcEncoding
   to work out how it works.  Now rewrite gnpcMessage to  
   use that same protocol. )
